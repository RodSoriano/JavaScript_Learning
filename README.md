Simple Js Crash Course 

Here I will be posting all my progress on my learning of the JavaScript lenguage. Hope this is of good use to you as it is to me, on each folder you can find excercises and examples that you can replicate, on the notes you can find miscellaneous information if not all of the information, I will try to be more organized with my notes but I don't promise anything, happy learning :)
